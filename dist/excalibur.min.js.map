resources for a game\n *\n * ```js\n * // create a loader\n * var loader = new ex.Loader();\n *\n * // create a resource dictionary (best practice is to keep a separate file)\n * var resources = {\n *

loader\n * for (var loadable in resources) {\n *   if (resources.hasOwnProperty(loadable)) {\n *     loader.addResource(resources[loadable]);\n *   }\n * }\n *\n * // start game\n * game.start(loader).then(function () {\n *   console.log(\"Game started!\");\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * ## Customize the Loader\n *\n * The loader can be customized to show different, text, logo, background color, and button.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * const loader = new ex.Loader([playerTexture]);\n *\n * // The loaders button text can simply modified using this\n * loader.playButtonText = 'Start the best game ever';\n *\n * // The logo can be changed by inserting a base64 image string here\n *\n * loader.logo = 'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw...';\n * loader.logoWidth = 15;\n * loader.logoHeight = 14;\n *\n * // The background color can be changed like so by supplying a valid CSS color string\n *\n * loader.backgroundColor = 'red'\n * loader.backgroundColor = '#176BAA'\n *\n * // To build a completely new button\n * loader.startButtonFactory = () => {\n *     let myButton = document.createElement('button');\n *     myButton.textContent = 'The best button';\n *     return
