# ⚠ ARCHIVED ⚠ Excalibur.js Distribution Repository

**This repository was originally built for things like bower and rawgit which no longer exist, maintaining this repo is an unnecessary burden. Future releases will be made from the [main repository](https://github.com/excaliburjs/Excalibur). **

You can find the source code in [the Excalibur.js main project](https://github.com/excaliburjs/Excalibur).

## What's in here?

These are the built files that can be used in your projects or included as a Git submodule. The `main` branch
is always kept up-to-date with the `main` branch in the main repo. Otherwise, you can reference the releases
and tags for stable versions.

## Install Excalibur

See [Installing Excalibur](http://docs.excaliburjs.com/en/latest/installation.html) documentation.
